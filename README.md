# pythonCalculator
A graphical user interface Python calculator!

The goal for this calculator is to have it mimic all or most of the functionality of the stock calculators on computers and phones.
I will attempt to make it more complicated over time.

# Get it working
in your terminal: \
`git clone https://github.com/nkathawa/PythonCalculator.git` \
`cd PythonCalculator` \
`brew install python-tk` \
`python3 MainApplication.py` \

# Test
